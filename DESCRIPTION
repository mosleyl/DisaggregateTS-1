Description: Generates 1- (potentially high-dimensional) high-frequency and low-frequency series for simulation studies in temporal disaggregation; 2- a toolkit utilizing temporal disaggregation and benchmarking techniques with a low-dimensional  matrix of indicator series previously proposed in the literature; and 3- novel techniques for disaggregating low-frequency series in the presence of high-dimensional indicator matrices.
